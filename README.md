# ‚ò∏Ô∏è K8s Pod Cleanup Operator

A Kubernetes Operator to clean up expired pods in any desired non-running state.

## üõ† What does it do?

This lightweight Kubernetes Operator will clean up expired pods in any desired non-running state.

For example, pods with `Evicted` or `Terminated` reason, or even all `Failed` or `Succeeded` pods regardless
of their termination reason, can be cleaned up.

Additionally, this operator can be used to clean up pods that are running for a specified amount of time.

To give a pod a certain lifetime, add the `pod.kubernetes.io/lifetime` annotation to the pod. The value of this annotation
needs to be a valid duration in a format [understandable to `parse_timedelta`](https://tempora.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#tempora.parse_timedelta).

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        pod.kubernetes.io/lifetime: "12 hours"
```

## üöÄ Usage and Deployment

- First, you need a _Kubernetes Service Account_ with the permission to look and, if necessary, delete Pods and Jobs.
- Then, adapt the [`deployment.yaml`](k8s/deployment.yaml) to suit your needs. This involves picking the correct image
  tag and modifying the `args` to suit your requirements.
- Lastly, apply the Deployment to your cluster.

_**Note:** You cannot create a Role that defines permissions unless you already have the permissions defined in the Role. If you
have been granted the [cluster-admin](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-roles#kubernetes-engine-roles) IAM role,
this is sufficient._

Apply the 3 `.yaml` files after you have adapted them:

```bash
$ kubectl apply --validate -f k8s/namespace.yaml -f k8s/rbac.yaml -f k8s/deployment.yaml
namespace/pod-cleanup created
serviceaccount/pod-cleanup-operator created
clusterrole.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pod-cleanup-operator created
clusterrolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/pod-cleanup-operator created
deployment.apps/pod-cleanup-operator created
```

| `--dry-run`                      |                              |                                   | If the `--dry-run` flag is set, no actual deletion is performed. This can be used for testing.                                                                                                               |

In addition to the parameters above, the application takes 1 or more status arguments that filter the set of pods to be
deleted based on their current state. Each of those arguments can either just be
[a status](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/) or a combination of status and reason of Pods
and Jobs that should be considered for deletion.

For example, passing `Failed` and `Succeeded` as arguments, would delete all pods that are in the `Failed` or `Succeeded`
state, regardless of their termination reason. Passing `Failed:Shutdown` as an argument would delete pods that are in `Failed`
state and have their termination reason set to `Shutdown`.

## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Running Locally

The Python script can use either a Service Account for authenticatiob (when deployed in Kubernetes) or your local
`~/.kube/config` file when running locally.

Make sure you have switched to the correct project and cluster and your `kubectl` is configured. Then, simply run
the `cleaner.py` script with the desired arguments:

```bash
$ python3 cleaner.py --graceperiod 60 --dry-run Failed:Shutdown
Pod Cleanup Operator. Version: 0.x, Commit: main, Build Date: 2021-07-06T13:36:10.700541+00:00
Using local ~/.kube/config for authentication
Deleted 0 pods and 0 jobs.
```

Alternatively, you can also use your own Service Account for authentication:

```bash
$ gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=<path to your generated json file>
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./serviceaccount.json python3 cleaner.py --graceperiod 60 --dry-run Failed:Shutdown
```

## ü§î What is a Kubernetes Operator?

A Kubernetes operator is an application-specific controller that extends the functionality of
the Kubernetes API to create, configure, and manage instances of complex applications on behalf
of a Kubernetes user.
